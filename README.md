# Reviews React Native App for Bytelion

Hey Cooper and the rest of the Bytelion Dev team,

### Here's what I've done on the code challenge so far --
I don't have an android so unfortunatley I wasn't unable to test the app for android before publishing to Expo- hopefully it looks okay if that's how your viewing it. I didn't have time to complete all of the functionality that the code challenge asked for, but you can find what I worked on at https://expo.io/@lydia_gregory/reviews.

Thanks,
Lydia
